## Etymology

Main article: Etymology of Kolkata

The word Kolkata ( Bengali: কলকাতা[\[kolˈkata\]]("Help:IPA/Bengali")) derives from Kôlikata (Bengali: কলিকাতা[\[ˈkɔliˌkata\]]("Help:IPA/Bengali")), the Bengali language name of one of three villages that predated the arrival of the British; the other two villages were Sutanuti and Govindapur.(

There are several explanations for the etymology of this name:

-   Kolikata is thought to be a variation of Kalikkhetrô ( Bengali: কালীক্ষেত্র[\[ˈkaliˌkʰetrɔ\]]("Help:IPA/Bengali")), meaning 'Field of \[the goddess\] Kali'. Similarly, it can be a variation of Kalikshetra ( Sanskrit: कालीक्षेत्र, lit. 'area of Goddess Kali').
-   Another theory is that the name derives from Kalighat.(

            **Kolkata**,[\[a\]]( also known as **Calcutta**[\[b\]]( ( its official name until 2001), is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of West Bengal. It lies on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River, 80 km (50 mi) west of the border with Bangladesh. It is the primary financial and commercial centre of eastern and northeastern India.[\[16\]]( Kolkata is the seventh most populous city in India with an estimated city proper population of 4.5 million (0.45 crore) while its metropolitan region Kolkata Metropolitan Area is the third most populous metropolitan region of India with a metro population of over 15 million (1.5 crore).[\[17\]]( Kolkata is regarded by many sources as the cultural capital of India and a historically and culturally significant city in the historic region of Bengal.[\[1\]](

Kolkata is known for its literary, artistic and revolutionary heritage; as the former capital of India, it was the birthplace of modern Indian literary and artistic thought.[\[250\]]( Kolkata has been called the "City of Furious, Creative Energy"[\[251\]]( as well as the "cultural \[or literary\] capital of India".[\[252\]]( The presence of _paras "Para (Bengali)")_, which are neighbourhoods that possess a strong sense of community, is characteristic of the city.[\[254\]]( Typically, each _para_ has its own community club and on occasion, a playing field.[\[254\]]( Residents engage in _addas "Adda (Indian)")_, or leisurely chats, that often take the form of freestyle intellectual conversation.[\[255\]]( The city has a tradition of political graffiti depicting everything from outrageous slander to witty banter and limericks, caricatures and propaganda.[\[257\]](

Kolkata is the commercial and financial hub of East and Northeast India[\[98\]]( and home to the Calcutta Stock Exchange.[\[107\]]( It is a major commercial and military port, and is one of five cities in eastern India (alongside Bhubaneswar, Guwahati, Imphal, and Kushinagar) to have an international airport. Once India's leading city, Kolkata experienced a steady economic decline in the decades following India's independence due to steep population increases and a rise in militant trade-unionism, which included frequent strikes that were backed by left-wing parties.[\[72\]]( From the 1960s to the late 1990s, several factories were closed and businesses relocated.[\[72\]]( The lack of capital and resources added to the depressed state of the city's economy and gave rise to an unwelcome sobriquet: the "dying city".[\[109\]]( The city's fortunes improved after the Indian economy was liberalised in the 1990s and changes in economic policy were enacted by the West Bengal state

A demographically diverse city, the culture of Kolkata features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively close-knit neighbourhoods "Para (Bengali)") ( _paras_) and freestyle conversations "Adda (South Asian)") ( _adda_). Kolkata's architecture includes many imperial landmarks, including the Victoria Memorial, Howrah Bridge and the Grand Hotel. The city's heritage includes India's only Chinatown and remnants of Jewish, Armenian, Greek and Anglo-Indian communities. The city is closely linked with Bhadralok culture and the Zamindars of Bengal, including Bengali Hindu, Bengali Muslim and tribal aristocrats. The city is often regarded as India's cultural capital.
